# TermoWiki

A Wiki termometer to evalute reliability of Wikipedia entries and their references.

This project started out during the No Budget Science Hack Week 2022 held in Rio de Janeiro.  
Our crew decided to work on a browser extension to get extra information about texts (metadata) when navigating in Wikipedia 

As of September 2022, the tool has Portuguese interface only.

Our project also features educational material (e.g. infographics) on how to evaluate information from Wikipedia.
